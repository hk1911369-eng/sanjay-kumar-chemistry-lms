# Version 8 source audit

## Inspected

- ZIP directory tree and all 57 archive entries.
- `package.json`, TypeScript/Next configuration and environment example.
- Supabase SSR server/middleware clients and authentication actions.
- Student, Teacher, Admin, public and portal pages.
- Payment server actions, health and deprecated checkout routes.
- All six supplied SQL migrations, existing RLS policies and role/payment functions.
- README, provisioning, hosting and payment handover notes.

## Findings

| Area | Version 8 state | v9 increment |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 15 / React 19 / TypeScript / Supabase SSR | Preserved; no framework upgrades |
| Dependency lock | No lockfile supplied | Still no lockfile; npm registry unreachable during this run |
| Authentication | Student signup, login, confirmation and role routing present | Added password recovery/update flow |
| Payment | Manual submission and Admin RPC review present | Added confirmation UI, sender phone field, stronger approval checks; still requires live DB verification |
| Role/RLS | Several role protections present, but broad staff policies remained | Added teacher assignment scope and removed broad teacher visibility for enrollments/payment events |
| Courses | Three fixed courses/৳700 guardrails present | Added Admin publication control; old unsupported rows remain unpublished and are not deleted |
| Learning | Minimal lesson table; no complete learning experience | Added chapters, lesson content, assignment scope and progress foundation |
| Teacher tools | Placeholder workspace | Added chapter/lesson creation and lesson editing |
| Student tools | Payment dashboard | Added profile editing, course access, lessons, progress and announcements |
| Localization | Language foundation absent/incomplete | Added locale cookie and public homepage switch; full bilingual coverage still incomplete |
| Public pages | Basic landing page only | Added catalogue, details, About, Contact, Privacy, Terms and FAQ |
| Tests | No automated test suite | Added 5 static guardrail tests; integration/browser tests remain outstanding |
| Deployment | Not configured/live | Netlify candidate and instructions prepared; no credentials/account access |

## Critical caveats

- The original archive's own progress notes stated that migrations had not been applied to a live database and no real production build/typecheck had been run.
- The v9 migration must be reviewed and applied to a test Supabase project before production.
- The source archive contained a historical receiving number in its old configuration/migration; the v9 copy removes that literal and leaves wallet settings blank/disabled.
- The application is not production-certified or live. Build, RLS integration, account, payment and browser tests remain blocked by missing dependencies, credentials and provider access.


## Version 9.1 review corrections (7 November 2026)

- Fixed the email confirmation callback's `next` redirect validation. It now resolves the destination and accepts only same-origin URLs, blocking backslash-normalized external redirects.
- Fixed the learning page query to include `chapter_id`, which the page uses to display chapter labels.
- Added regression guardrail tests for both corrections.
- Re-ran `npm test`: **7 passed**.

## Remaining release blockers

- No dependency lockfile is included.
- Dependency installation could not complete because the npm registry was unreachable/timed out in this environment; therefore the real TypeScript check and Next.js production build remain unverified.
- No Supabase test project was available, so migrations, RLS policies and role isolation have not been executed or integration-tested.
- No browser/mobile, email delivery, payment end-to-end or live deployment tests have been completed.
